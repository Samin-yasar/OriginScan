    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: June 27, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Welcome to OriginScan ("we," "us," or "our"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our Services, including our website at <a href="https://samin-yasar.github.io/OriginScan">https://samin-yasar.github.io/OriginScan</a>, the OriginScan barcode scanning application, and related features such as scan history, suspicious barcode reporting, and accessibility settings (collectively, the "Services"). By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use our Services.</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p class="highlight"><strong>In Short:</strong> Using OriginScan means you agree to these Terms.</p>
    <p>By using the Services, you confirm that you are of legal age to enter into this agreement or have obtained parental/guardian consent if under the legal age in your jurisdiction. You agree to comply with these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations. We may update these Terms periodically, and continued use of the Services after changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Services</h2>
    <p class="highlight"><strong>In Short:</strong> OriginScan provides barcode scanning to identify product origins, with features like scan history and reporting.</p>
    <p>OriginScan is a client-side barcode scanning tool that decodes barcodes (e.g., EAN-13, UPC-A) via camera, image uploads, or manual input to provide information about product origins. Features include displaying results in the "Product Origin" section, storing scans in the "Scan History," aggregating scan counts in "Scans Today," and allowing suspicious barcode reports. The Services rely on third-party APIs (e.g., OpenStreetMap, Rest Countries) for data such as country coordinates and population. All scanning and data processing occur locally in your browser, except for suspicious barcode reports, which are sent to our server.</p>

    <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p class="highlight"><strong>In Short:</strong> You must use OriginScan responsibly and lawfully.</p>
    <p>You agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Services in compliance with all applicable local, national, and international laws.</li>
      <li>Not use the Services for any illegal or unauthorized purpose, including submitting false or misleading information in suspicious barcode reports.</li>
      <li>Not attempt to reverse-engineer, modify, or interfere with the Services’ functionality, including the client-side code or third-party APIs.</li>
      <li>Ensure that any data you input (e.g., barcode numbers, report descriptions) does not infringe on third-party rights or contain harmful content.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and browser, as OriginScan stores data locally using your browser’s storage.</p>

    <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p class="highlight"><strong>In Short:</strong> We own OriginScan’s content; you may not copy or distribute it without permission.</p>
    <p>All content, code, design, and features of OriginScan, including but not limited to the website, application interface, and documentation, are owned by or licensed to us and protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works from the Services without our prior written consent. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Services for personal, non-commercial purposes as outlined in these Terms.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p class="highlight"><strong>In Short:</strong> OriginScan uses third-party APIs but is not responsible for their performance.</p>
    <p>OriginScan integrates with third-party services like OpenStreetMap for map coordinates and Rest Countries API for population data. These services are subject to their own terms and privacy policies, and we are not responsible for their availability, accuracy, or security. Any issues with third-party services should be directed to their respective providers.</p>

    <h2>6. Suspicious Barcode Reports</h2>
    <p class="highlight"><strong>In Short:</strong> You can submit reports, but we don’t guarantee action.</p>
    <p>You may submit suspicious barcode reports, including a barcode, description, and optional email. We reserve the right to review or disregard these reports at our discretion. We are not obligated to respond or take action and are not liable for any outcomes related to these submissions. You agree to provide accurate and lawful information in reports.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p class="highlight"><strong>In Short:</strong> We are not liable for damages from using OriginScan.</p>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, OriginScan, its developers, and affiliates shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Services, including but not limited to inaccuracies in scan results, reliance on provided data, or service interruptions. This includes damages for loss of profits, data, or other intangible losses, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

    <h2>8. No Warranty</h2>
    <p class="highlight"><strong>In Short:</strong> OriginScan is provided "as is" with no guarantees.</p>
    <p>The Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. We do not guarantee that the Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that scan results will accurately reflect a product’s origin, as barcode prefixes indicate registration country, not necessarily manufacturing location.</p>

    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
    <p class="highlight"><strong>In Short:</strong> We can suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services at our discretion, without notice, if you violate these Terms or engage in unlawful or harmful activities. You may stop using the Services at any time by ceasing to access the website or application.</p>

    <h2>10. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p class="highlight"><strong>In Short:</strong> These Terms are governed by Bangladesh law, with disputes resolved through arbitration.</p>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Bangladesh, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising from or related to these Terms or the Services shall be resolved through binding arbitration in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in accordance with the rules of the Bangladesh International Arbitration Centre. You agree to waive any right to a jury trial or class action proceedings.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p class="highlight"><strong>In Short:</strong> We may update these Terms, and continued use means you accept changes.</p>
    <p>We may revise these Terms at any time, with updates indicated by a revised "Last updated" date. Significant changes will be posted prominently on our website. Your continued use of the Services after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
